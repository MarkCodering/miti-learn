## Miti-learn - Machine Learning for Quantum Error Mitigation 
Miti-learn is a Python package for machine learning based quantum error mitigation. It is designed to be a flexible and user-friendly tool for researchers and practitioners to develop and apply machine learning models for quantum error mitigation.

##  Authors
[Mark Chen - Quantum Machine Learning Researcher](https://github.com/MarkCodering)

## Installation
To install the package, you can use pip:
```bash
pip install miti-learn
```

## Usage
The package provides a high-level API for training and applying machine learning models for quantum error mitigation. The following example demonstrates how to use the package to train a machine learning model for quantum error mitigation and apply it to mitigate errors in a quantum circuit.

```python
import miti_learn as miti

mitigator = miti.MitiLearn()
model = mitigator.load_model(num_qubits=5, model_type='linear')

mitigated_circuit = mitigator.apply_model(model, noisy_circuit)
```
